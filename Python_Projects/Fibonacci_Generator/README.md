# Fibonacci Generator
Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of its two preceding numbers. A 
Fibonacci number sequence is defined mathematically by its recurrence relationship 
**Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2** <br>
**Where F0=0 and F1=1** <br>
In this project, a recursive function is developed to generate the first n numbers of the Fibonacci series.
