# Snake Game
With older Nokia phones, we had an old-age addiction with the snake game. But of course, we don’t have it anymore. Using the following libraries we can play it again:
- **Turtle:** It’s a pre-installed Python library that lets users create shapes and pictures using a virtual canvas.
- **Time:** Use this function to count how many seconds have passed since the epoch.
- **Random:** This function generates random numbers in Python by using the random module.

Just follow this easy *steps*! Download the file of this folder (Snake_Game), open it in any open source enviroment (i use Spyder IDE) and then run it. You use your keyboards arrows and enjoy!
