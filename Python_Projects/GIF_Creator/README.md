# GIF Creator
A ***GIF*** is an animated series of images that conveys an impression of movement. As famous as the gif market has become over these years now, demand for quality gifs is going up. The majority of people 
use these to communicate with others on social media platforms like WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. In this folder, I build a GIF Creator that creates ***GIFs*** from images. Also there is an extra GIF Creator 
which creates ***GIFs*** from video using the **MoviePy** module. **MoviePy** is a *Python* module that can be used to edit video (for example, to make cuts, concatenations, and title insertions), to do 
video compositing (also known as non-linear editing), or to do video processing. It is capable of reading and writing the most common video formats, including ***GIFs***.
